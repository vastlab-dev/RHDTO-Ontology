# RHDTO Ontology
*RHDTO - An Ontology for the Implementation of Reactive Heritage Digital Twins*

## Scope
This is the repository of the RHDTO Ontology, a model for cultural heritage based on the concept of digital twin. The ontology is a compatible extension of the CIDOC CRM ISO standard for cultural heritage documentation, and is primarily conceived as a conceptual tool to capture the dual nature of cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, and to provide, through specific classes and properties, a mechanism for dynamically documenting and analyzing their mutual relationships. It is also designed to model their digital counterparts and the mechanisms that make them interconnected and interoperable, fostering the implementation of complex digital twin systems. The ontology also provides the conceptual tools to describe the reactivity that digital twins are able to deploy for cultural heritage documentation and preservation, by including the semantic description of sensors, signals, activators and all of the process of interacting with real world objects.
